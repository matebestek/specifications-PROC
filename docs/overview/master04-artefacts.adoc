= Care Process Artefacts and their Formalisation

Various kinds of potentially formalisable artefact commonly used in healthcare are implied by the needs described earlier, including the following:

* _care pathway_: evidence-based plan of a complex care condition;
* _clinical practice guideline (CPG)_: evidence-based protocol for a specific clinical task;
* _order set_: 'template' set of combined orders for tests, medications etc relating to a condition;
* _care plan_: descriptive plan for individual patient care, typically either oriented to in-patient care or post-discharge nursing care.

These artefacts do not constitute the totality of requirements of formal care process models, because they generally do not take into account the cognitive aspect of their use in care delivery by human professionals. The final inferences, decisions and actions of the latter will often use pathways and guidelines as a major input but only in the 'copilot' sense described above. 

Nevertheless, the formalisation of the semantics of these artefacts is a major part of the overall semantics of the languages described here. Accordingly, what these are considered to consist of within the openEHR process architecture, and how they interrelate is described below.

== Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs) and Care Pathways

_Clinical practice guidelines_ (CPGs) and _care pathways_ are two kinds of published, evidence-based artefact used in clinical medicine, designed as structured aids to providing care.

NOTE: in openEHR documents and specifications, the term _guideline_ is used as a synonym for clinical practice guideline.

A common definition of a guideline is (emphasis added):

* a systematically developed statement designed to assist health care professionals and patients make decisions about appropriate health care for _specific clinical circumstances_ ({cemb_oxford}[Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine^]).

Guidelines are usually either _therapeutic_, i.e. oriented to describing a procedure e.g. intubation, asthma management, or _diagnostic_, such as for diagnosing various forms of angina. Many diagnostic guidelines are relatively simple scores based on a number of patient variables, whose aim is to stratify risk into categories corresponding to type of intervention. Examples of guidelines include:

* {chad2ds2vasc_score}[CHA2DS2â€“VASc stroke risk score^];
* {nice_uk_stable_angina}[UK NICE Stable angina management guideline^];
* {acep_covid_19_severity_tool_pdf}[American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) Covid19 Severity Classification tool^];
* Australian Clinical Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Atrial Fibrillation 2018 cite:[Afib_NHFA_CSANZ_2018].

The notion of care pathway, also known by names such as 'integrated care pathway' (ICP) and 'critical care pathway', has various definitions in healthcare, such as summarised by the {e_p_a_care_pathways}[European Pathway Association (E-P-A)^] and many other authors and organisations. Based on these, we take a care pathway to be:

* a structured description of _complex care_ based on evidence, oriented to managing a particular primary condition;
* patient-centric (rather than institution- or procedure-centric) and therefore multi-disciplinary and cross-enterprise.

A care pathway is thus a higher-level entity aimed at achieving a _patient outcome_, whereas a guideline is aimed at performing a more specific professional task. Consequently, care pathways typically refer to one or more guidelines that describe in detail how to deal with specific situations within the management of the condition (citenp:[Schrijvers_et_al2012], citenp:[Vanhaecht_et_al2007]). Care pathway examples include:

* {nice_uk_pathways}[UK NICE Sepsis pathway^];
* {cancer_council_australia_breast}[Cancer Council Australia Breast cancer pathway^];
* {ihc_stroke_pathway}[Intermountain Healthcare Acute Stroke CPM^].

Care pathways and guidelines are published based on studies performed on the available evidence base e.g. at an institution, within a specific disease cohort, or more widely. There are a couple of important issues that affect potential formalisation.

The first is the problem of _partial coverage_. There is  no guarantee that any particular condition will have a published care pathway, consequently, the definition of a pathway for a particular patient (type) may be undertaken locally by institutions and/or simply achieved by 'old school medicine'. This implies that some automatable patient plans will be developed manually rather than from any existing pathway template.

The second is the problem of _adaptation_, which can be divided into two sub-problems. The first is that each pathway or guideline is designed to address _one primary condition_ (sepsis, ARDS, angina etc) and will not generally be applicable unmodified to a real patient, due to patient specifics including co-morbidities, phenotypic specificities, current medications and patient needs and preferences. We might term this as a _merge_ problem since it is essentially a question of arriving at a safe pathway for an actual patient that accounts for all of the patient's current conditions (and therefore multiple applicable care pathways), medications and phenotypic specifics. Secondly, local practice factors such as formulary, local protocols, type of care setting (community clinic/hospital versus tertiary care centre/teaching hospital), availability and cost of imaging, drugs for rare conditions etc, will often constrain and/or modify any standard pathways or guidelines. We can understand this as a _localisation_ problem.

Due to the merge problem, _more than one pathway may apply to a patient_, e.g. one for chronic care and one for an acute situation. There may be conflicts between the pathways - commonly in medications recommendations - but also between the pathways and the other patient specificities. Well-written pathways and CPGs usually include obvious contra-indications for medications (e.g. being on anti-rejection medications post transplant conflicts with some chemotherapy drug classes), common phenotypic features (e.g. being female, being allergic to taxanes), and patient history (e.g. being pregnant). There is no guarantee that any given pathway or guideline covers all possible conflicts, hence manual _inspection, adjustment and customisation_ is almost always required. Localisation factors often means further modifications or constraints.

For convenience, we term a care pathway- or guideline-like artefact for a specific patient, however arrived at and incorporating any necessary conflict resolution, merging and localisation, a _patient plan_.

With respect to the challenge of applying information technology to process-oriented care, key questions to do with published (natural language) pathways and guidelines are:

* the extent to which they are formally representable, including contra-indications and conflicts;
* how conflict, merge and localisation is solved to produce an automatable patient plan.

We make a baseline assumption that guidelines and care pathways are essentially the same kind of entity in terms of structure, and are formalisable with the same model or language, with any differences (e.g. in goal or subject) handled by variable elements of the formalism. A survey of published pathways and guidelines shows that they consist of:

* _goal_ (pathway) or _purpose_ (guideline);
* _indications_, i.e. clinical pre-conditions for use;
* structured natural language statements describing a _plan_, also commonly known as _tasks_ or _activities_, which may be sequential or parallel, and which may include activities relating to:
** orders or order sets;
** medication administration;
* _classification rules_ that convert a real-world value to a classification for the purpose of the guideline, e.g.:
** SpO2 of 88% -> 'critical' in a Covid19 assessment tool;
** Systolic pressure > 160 mm[Hg] -> 'high', in a hypertension guideline;
* decision rules, flowcharts and tables that act as related _rule-sets_, defining the primary logic of the artefact, e.g. a risk classification for a patient based on N variables.

Formalising such a structure for automation primarily involves finding sufficiently powerful language(s) for the plan and logic (i.e. rules) parts. Assuming this can be achieved, the second challenge then requires support within tools such that formal patient-level plans could be adapted in a fine-grained from existing pathways and CPGs and/or developed _de novo_ when needed.

== Order Set

Within the above-described artefacts references to so-called _order sets_ may exist. An order set is generally understood as:

* a set of orders for diagnostic tests and/or medications and/or other therapies that are used together to achieve a particular clinical goal, e.g. the drugs for a particular chemotherapy regimen are often modelled as an order set;
* potentially a detailed plan for administration of the items in the order set, which may be a fully planned out schedule of single administrations on particular days and times;
* descriptive meta-data, including authors, history, evidence base, etc.

In most EHR/EMR sytems, the first item corresponds to a set of 'orders' or 'prescriptions', while the second is a candidate for representation as a formalised plan. 

In the openEHR process architecture, an 'order set' is considered to be a plan artefact, whose initial actions consist of a _condition-specific set of orders_ with associated descriptive information. Administration actions may follow, within the same plan. Similarly to a care pathway, an order set may need to be modified for use with a real patient due to interactions or contra-indications, and any administration plan provided (perhaps as a template) may need to be copied and adapted for use in a larger patient-specific plan.

=== Care Plan

The care plan is a common artefact within clinical care, originating in nursing. Definitions include {rn_central_care_plan}[a nursing-oriented definition from RN-central^] and one from the {iso_13940}[ISO Continuity of Care standard ('contsys')^]. From these we synthesise the following definition:

* _care plan_ - a dynamic, personalised plan, relating to one or more specified health issues, that describes patient objectives and goals, defining diagnoses and steps for resolution and monitoring.

Historically, a care plan has been a _description_ of intended care that may be followed by relevant staff e.g. home-visit nurses. A patient may have more than one care plan, and the contents of a care plan may be informed by one or more care pathways and/or CPGs, or might be 'standard local practice'. A care plan may even be _ad hoc_ in the case of a patient type with no well-described models of care available.

Within the openEHR process architecture, a care plan is considered a structured artefact whose contents are consumed by human actors, rather than being a directly automatable entity. It is assumed to include items such as:

* identifier and purpose;
* descriptive text;
* potentially references to CPG(s) or care pathway(s) that apply, with any modifictions necessary;
* goals and targets;
* relevant problems and diagnoses;
* interventions: medication and other orders (and potentially order sets);
* monitoring criteria / instructions.

A care plan may be formalised in the sense that the referenced CPG(s) and/or care pathway are formalised as a personalised patient plan (per above).

=== General Vision

The clinical artefacts described so far may be classified as follows, for the purposes of potential computable representation:

* _automatable artefacts_: care pathways, guidelines, order set administration plans;
* _structured artefacts_: care plans.

Automatable artefacts are assumed to consist of at least three kinds of element:

* _descriptive_: structured description, identification etc;
* _workflow_: a representation of tasks, activities etc;
* _decision logic_: a representation of decisions, rules, ultimately based on a combination of _subject variable_ values and clinical evidence based logic, ranges, threshold values etc. 

None of the above artefacts acts directly as an _executable plan_ for a specific subject (i.e. patient). Care pathways and guidelines each relate to a single isolated condition or procedure, whereas the general situation for a real patient is multiple conditions plus phenotypic specificities (e.g. allergies) plus current situation (e.g. being pregnant) plus non-clinical elements (e.g. patient preferences, type of health plan cover etc). Adaptation and merging is in general unavoidable.

Although there is no commonly recognised term for an automatable patient-specific plan, we assume its existence and term such an artefact a _patient plan_ for convenience, and make the assumption that for the purposes of formal representation it is a combination of:

* a care plan that describes the intended care approach (may be minimal in some circumstances, e.g. emergency);
* a potentially executable pathway of the same _formal representation_ as a care pathway or guideline, but whose content is adapted from relevant automatable CPGs and/or care pathways, where available.

Since a computable patient plan may originate from a full care pathway, such as for complex pregnancy, or a simple guideline, such as {chad2ds2vasc_score}[CHA2DS2â€“VASc^], it may express any level of clinical detail.

The various clinical artefacts described above and related computational entities, along with their relationships, can be visualised as follows.

In the diagram, the term _executable plan_ is used to denote any formal representation of workflow and related decision logic that could be executed by an appropriate engine. A computable plan can thus be used to represent both condition-specific guidelines, care pathways as well as a patient plan. For the latter, it is assumed that the executable representation of a care plan may be included, where one exists.

Entities shown with dotted lines are not assumed to exist in all real world clinical situations. That is, care may be being provided for a patient for which no published care pathway is available, and only limited published guidelines. This would imply no or limited availability of condition-specific executable plans for use in constructing an executable patient plan. Nevertheless, the latter could be constructed _de novo_, rather than by adaptation of library pathways or guidelines.
